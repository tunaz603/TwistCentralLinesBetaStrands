Quantification of Twist from the Central Lines of β-Strands

Description: 

I worked in twist analysis of β-strands from atomic structures of a protein. Accurate measurement of twist angles is important in identification of β-strands from such density maps. We proposed an effective method to quantify twist angles from a set of splines. In a data set of 55 pairs of β-strands from 11 β-sheets of 11 proteins, the spline measurement showed comparable results as measured using the discrete method that used atomic positions directly, particularly in capturing twist angle change along a pair, different levels of twist among different pairs, and the average of twist angles. The proposed method provides an alternative method to characterize twist using the central lines of a β-sheet.
